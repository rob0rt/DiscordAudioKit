    /// resolution of the clock MUST be sufficient for the desired
    /// synchronization accuracy and for measuring packet arrival jitter
    /// (one tick per video frame is typically not sufficient).  The clock
    /// frequency is dependent on the format of data carried as payload
    /// and is specified statically in the profile or payload format
    /// specification that defines the format, or MAY be specified
    /// dynamically for payload formats defined through non-RTP means.  If
    /// RTP packets are generated periodically, the nominal sampling
    /// instant as determined from the sampling clock is to be used, not a
    /// reading of the system clock.  As an example, for fixed-rate audio
    /// the timestamp clock would likely increment by one for each
    /// sampling period.  If an audio application reads blocks covering
    /// 160 sampling periods from the input device, the timestamp would be
    /// increased by 160 for each such block, regardless of whether the
    /// block is transmitted in a packet or dropped as silent.
    ///
    /// The initial value of the timestamp SHOULD be random, as for the
    /// sequence number.  Several consecutive RTP packets will have equal
    /// timestamps if they are (logically) generated at once, e.g., belong
    /// to the same video frame.  Consecutive RTP packets MAY contain
    /// timestamps that are not monotonic if the data is not transmitted
    /// in the order it was sampled, as in the case of MPEG interpolated
    /// video frames.  (The sequence numbers of the packets as transmitted
    /// will still be monotonic.)
    /// 
    /// RTP timestamps from different media streams may advance at
    /// different rates and usually have independent, random offsets.
    /// Therefore, although these timestamps are sufficient to reconstruct
    /// the timing of a single stream, directly comparing RTP timestamps
    /// from different media is not effective for synchronization.
    /// Instead, for each medium the RTP timestamp is related to the
    /// sampling instant by pairing it with a timestamp from a reference
    /// clock (wallclock) that represents the time when the data
    /// corresponding to the RTP timestamp was sampled.  The reference
    /// clock is shared by all media to be synchronized.  The timestamp
    /// pairs are not transmitted in every data packet, but at a lower
    /// rate in RTCP SR packets as described in Section 6.4.

    /// The sampling instant is chosen as the point of reference for the
    /// RTP timestamp because it is known to the transmitting endpoint and
